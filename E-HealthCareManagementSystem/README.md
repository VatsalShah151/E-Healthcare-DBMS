## E- HealthCare Management System
The E-HealthCare Management System is a Java program developed using OOP concepts to carry out efficient management of hospitals and clinics, by taking care of the requirements of all the stakeholders such as doctors, patients and staff.
Hospitals and clinics can use such program to record and maintain data of patients and doctors.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

##Future Tasks
1. Add more actors to the system by creating a login feature to enable doctors, patients and admin to login into the system.
2. Use a database like PostgreSQL to store the data of Patients and Doctors.
